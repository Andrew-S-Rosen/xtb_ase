# Third-Party Apps

## Overview

There are several configuration files provided for popular third-party applications that can be quite useful:

1. The `/.deepsource.toml` file is a configuration file for the web platform [DeepSource](https://deepsource.com/), which has a useful GitHub extension for cleaning up your code and spotting common errors.
2. The `/.sourcery.yaml` file is a configuration file for [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/), which can automatically refactor your code.
3. The `/.codecov.yml` file is a configuration file for [Codecov](https://codecov.io/), which will tell you the fraction of lines covered by your test suite if the GitHub integration is enabled.
